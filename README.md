## Overview
Demusicfy is a cross platform application for `iOS` and `Android`. Currently, there are two main functionalities of this app: Metronome and Chord Finder. 

The Chord finder is a visual representation of a guitar's fretboard. Given the selected root note and other extension note(s) pressed by the user, it will calculate the given chord. If you decide you want to save that visualization for later, Demusicfy allows your to create a 'chord profile' where it saves the given chord on the screen, intervals, and a nickname of your choosing - now you can revisit this specific chord layout anytime. 

The Metronome is just like any other metronome where the bpm can be adjusted to your timing needs. Additionally, you can choose between various metronome sounds to fit your liking. When your finished, there's no need to remember what BPM a song was set to as you can create metronome profiles (similiar to chord profiles) that enable you to set the metronome with the press of a button.
